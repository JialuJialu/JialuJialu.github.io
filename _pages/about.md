I am a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, working with 
Prof. [Steven Holtzen](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Justin Hsu](https://justinhsu.net/). 

My research interests mainly lie in **formal verifications** and **programming language theory**. 
My Ph.D. research focuses on the verifcation of randomized algorithms. 
The correctness and performance of randomized algorithms are often difficult to test or reason about. I design **probabilistic separation logic** to leverage on probabilistic dependencies and independence to enable simpler and more compositional **formal proofs** of their correctness. 
Recently, I am also working on **probabilistic inference with guarantees**. While probabilistic inference, i.e., updating the prior in probabilistic models based on new information, 
is inherently a computationally hard task, it can be efficient under certain conditions. I aim to use programming language techniques to automatically derive guarantees 
for probabilistic inference tasks programmed by the users.
