I am a computer science Ph.D. student at Cornell, working on the verification of randomized algorithms. The correctness and performance of randomized algorithms are often difficult to test or reason about. I want to address this problem by enabling simple and compositional **formal proofs** of probabilistic programs. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Justin Hsu](https://justinhsu.net/) to explore my interests. 

Before moving to Cornell with my advisor, I spent two wonderful years at University of Wisconsin -- Madison as a Ph.D. student, 
and prior to that, I did my undergrad also at Cornell majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.
